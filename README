MSc Thesis Project 

This repository contains the source code of my MSc thesis project: 
implementation of various (3 up to now) Multiparty Key Agreement protocols, 
i.e. generalization  of the famous Diffie-Hellman key exchange. 
The target platform is an embedded bare metal environment, 
specifically I've developed all the code on a stm32f407 discovery board, 
mouting an arm cortex-m4 processor. The protocol used to communicate between the 
board is KNX, up to now the physical transmission works through the uart 
peripheral provided by the board.

All the code to set up and manage the board hardware and peripherals 
(all the code related to the board is in the stm32f4d_helper module) 
have been taken or adapeted from this nice repository of dwelch67:

https://github.com/dwelch67/stm32f4d

Up to now I'm not using the standard st library, therefore the code dealing 
with the board is really low level, but nonetheless very instructive 
since I have to manage a bunch of stuff (leds, uart1 and uart6, interrupts etc).

All the crytpo primitives needed to implement the aforementioned protocols 
are provided by the PolarSSL library:

The great thing about this library is that it is designed to run on embedded 
devices and so it is written in a very elegant, easy to understand 
and modular fashion. 
Algorithms implemented so far:

- BD1(M. Burmester, Y. Desmedt, A Secure and Efficient Conference Key Distribution System)
- BD2 (M. Burmester, Y. Desmedt, Efficient and Secure Conference Key Distribution)
- MKA-abp (A. Antonini, A. Barenghi, G. Pelosi, Security Analysis of Building Automation Networks
Threat Model and Viable Mitigation Techniques)
Indeed in the project there are only the modules needed by my algorithms nothing more.
